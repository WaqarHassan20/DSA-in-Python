# # ‚è± Time and üß† Space Complexity:
# # Both sum_N(sum, iterator, limit) and sumByBackTracking(num) perform one recursive call per level, and process from 1 to n, so they both have time complexity O(n).

# # For sum_N(...), although it is written in a tail-recursive style, Python does not optimize tail calls, so it still uses O(n) stack space.

# # For sumByBackTracking(...), it is non-tail (head) recursion with computation after the recursive call, so it also uses O(n) space.

# # üëâ Therefore, for both functions:
# # ‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(n)
# # ‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(n)

# ‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(n)
# The function calls itself once for each number from n down to 1.

# So it performs n recursive calls and n - 1 multiplications.

# ‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(n)
# Each recursive call is added to the call stack.

# Since Python does not support tail call optimization, the stack grows up to n frames.

# Conclusion:
# For the input n, the recursive factorial function has:
# üîπ Time Complexity: O(n)
# üîπ Space Complexity: O(n)
