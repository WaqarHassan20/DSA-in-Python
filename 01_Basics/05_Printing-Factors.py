# This brute-force method checks every number from 1 to n. If the number divides n completely (remainder is 0), it is a factor and is added to the list.

# üß† Space Complexity:
# O(k): Where k is the number of factors (usually less than n), stored in a list.

# üß† Working Logic:
# Instead of checking all the way to n, it only checks up to n/2, since no number greater than n/2 (except n itself) can divide n. Finally, it adds n as a factor manually.

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
# O(n/2) = O(n): Still linear but slightly faster than the full loop.

# üß† Space Complexity:
# O(k): Same as before ‚Äî number of factors stored.

#     üß† Working Logic:
# This method leverages the fact that factors appear in pairs:

# If i divides n, then n/i is also a factor.

# So, it only checks up to ‚àön, and for every factor found, it adds both i and n//i, avoiding duplicates.

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
# O(‚àön) ‚Äî Significantly more efficient for large numbers.

# üß† Space Complexity:
# O(k) ‚Äî Number of factors collected, but the loop itself uses constant space.
